TLD 1.0 (Predator)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLD is an algorithm for tracking of unknown objects in unconstrained video streams. The object of interest is defined by a bounding box in a single frame. TLD simultaneously tracks the object, learns its appearance and detects it whenever it appears in the video.

To use TLD:
It's crucial to choose the opencv lib you compiled with.
You need to make sure ocl and superres is not in the complied list.
Otherwise you will obtain an error when calling complied lk.
